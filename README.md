This project is based on the [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects, using the sidemenu template. The only different is, this project has been modified to use Lazy Loading as default. All the pages now is being implemented to use Lazy Loading feature.

The now, we didnt have to import the pages anymore. We just need to define name of the page.

## TODO
* need to explain more on how to add more pages inside readme
